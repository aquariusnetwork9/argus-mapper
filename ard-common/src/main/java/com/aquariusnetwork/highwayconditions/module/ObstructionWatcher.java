/**
 * Mode-agnostic "is the road obstructed here" stall watchdog (PROTOCOL.md §5.1).
 *
 * <p>This is a fresh, independent implementation — {@code ElytraPilot}'s own bounce-stall
 * timer is private and module-scoped, so it can't be hooked from here. The pattern mirrors it
 * (per-tick XZ position delta vs. a speed threshold) but generalizes the threshold: rather
 * than a fixed blocks/sec constant (which is flight-tuned), the trigger is relative to the
 * bot's own recently-observed peak speed, so one detector works whether the bot is walking,
 * Baritone-driving, or elytra-bouncing without per-mode constants.
 *
 * <p>This IS the sign/item-frame filter: decorative signs and item frames have negligible
 * collision and essentially never sustain a real stall, so they're excluded by construction —
 * no block/entity-type blacklist is needed. If something ever DOES cause a genuine 3s+ stall,
 * whatever is physically there is worth reporting regardless of what it is (see the
 * classification scan in {@link HighwayReporterModule}).
